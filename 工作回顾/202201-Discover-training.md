## working with actors

deliver a bad message.
assertive approach, 
deliver clearly you are the problem, not mine, 
then take a deep breath. how i can help you in the process.


deliver a bad message. turn down job interview:
the recipients requires time to absort the message. 
for this sort of negative news, it takes time for him to understand and absorb.
not overload him for new info.
